# EUEmail-Network-Clustering
This is a sample of my coding for graduate research. The code is in Python and was created using Jupyter Notebook. 

This code looks for clusters within an EU email network from the Stanford Large Network Datasets. First, we create the original network and assign department labels. The departments will be our ground-truth communities since we would expect communication within departments to be greater than communication between departments. We get the largest five ground truth groups and gather some group statistics from the network. We also look at the degree distribution for the largest ground-truth group. Next, we run a variation of the COPRA label propagation algorithm on the weighted email network, where connections are weighted by the number of reciprocated emails. Again, we look at statistics of the largest five groups and the degree distribution of the largest group. Note: we cannot directly compare members between ground-truth and the algorithm given the structure of the data. Finally, we run a leading clustering algorithm: the Markov clustering algorithm. We extract the same data from the largest clusters for comparison. We can finally compare some high level statistics between all the largest groups found.
